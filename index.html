         <h2>About Us</h2>
         <p>We’re two sisters who share a lifelong love for baking. Baba Cakes was born from our passion for creating treats that bring warmth, joy, and a sense of togetherness. We make custom cakes for weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, and every kind of celebration that brings people closer. Our cupcakes are crafted with care and decorated to match each client’s unique vision. As the Baba family from eMthatha in the Eastern Cape, we believe cakes are more than just desserts — they are a way to celebrate love, family, and friendship. Every cake we bake carries a piece of our heart and the warmth of home.</p>
